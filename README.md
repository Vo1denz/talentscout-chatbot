# TalentScout AI - Hiring Assistant Chatbot

TalentScout AI is an intelligent Streamlit-based chatbot designed to assist tech recruitment agencies in the **initial screening** of candidates. It gathers essential applicant information, dynamically generates technical questions based on the candidate’s tech stack, and allows candidates to submit their answers — all in a seamless conversational interface.

---

## Project Overview

This chatbot simulates a smart hiring assistant that:
- Collects personal and professional details from candidates
- Asks 3–5 relevant technical questions based on their declared tech stack
- Allows candidates to answer the questions in the same session
- Provides a summary of the answers for review

## ⚙️ Technical Details
- `streamlit` for UI and form handling

- `google-generativeai` to call            Gemini                                                                                                                                        

- `python-dotenv` for managing API keys securely

- `re` for regular expressions to filter and clean up Gemini's output

- `time` to introduce delays during retry logic (ensuring full question generation)

### 🧰 Libraries Used
- `streamlit` – UI framework
- `google-generativeai` – Gemini API SDK
- `python-dotenv` – for loading API keys securely
- `re` – regular expressions for filtering response content

### 🧠 LLM Used
- **Model:** `gemini-2.5-flash`
- **Provider:** Google AI Studio
- **Why Flash?** Fast response time, lower latency, cost-effective

### 🧱 Architecture
- Frontend: Streamlit interface
- Backend: Python with session-state handling
- Model interaction: Prompt sent to Gemini via API → cleaned → displayed

---

## ✨ Prompt Design

The chatbot uses a **custom-crafted prompt** to request Gemini to:
- Generate *exactly* 5 technical questions
- Format each question clearly, one per line
- Avoid any introductory or explanatory content
- Maintain context across the conversation for future expansion (e.g., follow-up questions)

We also included a robust filter to **detect only actual questions** from the output using `?` and regex patterns.

## ⚠️ Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Gemini Flash sometimes returned only 2–3 questions | Added strict prompt instructions and retry logic to enforce 5 |
| Extra junk like titles in output | Used regex filtering to extract only proper questions |
| Session crashes on missing data | Initialized all session state variables safely |
| Quota errors from Gemini | Switched from `gemini-pro` to `gemini-2.5-flash`, added fallbacks |
| Needed graceful end | Added "End Conversation" button with `st.session_state.clear()` |
